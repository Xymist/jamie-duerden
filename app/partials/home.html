<h2>Hey there</h2>
<p>I'm Jamie, as you may have guessed already. By day I pretend I know something about IT and communications systems;
    whenever I can arrange some free time I try to convert it into as many skills as possible. I think the general
    sense is something along the lines of 'jack of all trades, master of none': I'm less interested in being the best at
    something than in being usefully good at everything.</p>
<p>I have a blog, as you can see from the sidebar. This is part of a wider experiment in establishing a coherent online
    persona; dropping some of the many services and names I use in favour of my own name and a small set of necessary
    functions. I don't think I can abandon Facebook, due to the number of people with whom that is my only communication
    channel, but I've thrown aside G+, Twitter and Skype.</p>
<p>If you're the sort of person who cares what people read, I have a GoodReads page <a
        href="https://www.goodreads.com/jamieduerden">here;</a> I only recently discovered the service, but it's already
    proving quite handy. My 'to read' shelf both physically and digitally is overstuffed.</p>
