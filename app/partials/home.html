<h2>Hey there</h2>
<p>I'm Jamie, as you may have guessed already. By day I pretend I know something about IT and communications systems;
    whenever I can arrange some free time I try to convert it into as many skills as possible. I think the general
    sense is something along the lines of 'jack of all trades, master of none': I'm less interested in being the best at
    something than in being usefully good at everything.</p>
<p>I have a blog, as you can see from the sidebar. This is part of a wider experiment in establishing a coherent online
    persona; dropping some of the many services and names I use in favour of my own name and a small set of necessary
    functions. I don't think I can abandon Facebook, due to the number of people with whom that is my only communication
    channel, but I've thrown aside G+, Twitter and Skype.</p>
<p>If you're the sort of person who cares what people read, I have a GoodReads page <a
        href="https://www.goodreads.com/jamieduerden">here;</a> I only recently discovered the service, but it's already
    proving quite handy. My 'to read' shelf both physically and digitally is overstuffed.</p>

<h3>Contact Details</h3>
<p>If you need to get hold of me, email is preferable; it's the only mode of communication I reliably check.</p>
<p>Missives sent to <a href="mailto:jamie@jamieduerden.co.uk">this email address</a> will be checked the same day. If
    you have another email address for me, it's deprecated, but will still be checked once a week or so until
    2015-12-31, at which point I will be assuming nobody uses those addresses any more and anything you send me will
    vanish into the aether.</p>
<p>I strongly prefer that anything you send me be encrypted; my public key is <a
        href="/site/app/assets/txt/jamie-pgp.txt">here</a>. If you can sign it as well, even better.</p>
<p>If you want to hire me for something, please include [Negotium] in your subject line - that will ensure it gets
    properly filtered and I pay attention to it in a timely manner.</p>
